Remember: every corpse on Mt. Everest was once a motivated person.
The light at the end of the tunnel might be an oncoming train.
Just because you’re special, doesn’t mean you’re useful
It's never too late to give up.
Trying is the first step to failing!
The early bird catches the worm but the second mouse eats the cheese.
